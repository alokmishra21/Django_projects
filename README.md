# Django_projects

This directory is to store the django projects. Currently, I'm working on local library project. It's a local library project because it's having very limited functionality and it's for learning purpose only. I have taken reference for this project from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django
